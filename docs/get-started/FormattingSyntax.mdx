# Formatting Syntax

import * as FormattingSyntaxStories from '../ts/FormattingSyntax.stories';

Two types of syntax are available in React Clay Editor.

- Bracket-based syntax coming from [Scrapbox](https://scrapbox.io/product?lang=en)
- Markdown-based syntax coming from [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

**NOTE**: The syntaxes in React Clay Editor are NOT necessarily same with the original ones.

## Itemization

### Bracket-based syntax

```
␣itemization
␣␣nested itemization
```

(␣ means a whitespace) goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.BracketItemization} />

### Markdown-based syntax

```
* asterisk itemization
- hyphen itemization
␣* nested asterisk itemization
␣- nested hyphen itemization
```

(␣ means a whitespace) goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.MarkdownItemization} />

## Heading, Bold, Italic and Underline

### Bracket-based syntax

```
[*** Largest Heading]
[** Larger Heading]
[* Normal Heading]
This is [* bold text]
This is [/ italic text]
This is [_ underlined text]
```

goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.BracketDecoration} />

Combinations of bold, italic and underline are available. For instance,

```
This is [*/ bold italic text]
This is [/_ italic underlined text]
This is [_* underlined bold text]
```

goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.BracketCombinedDecoration} />

### Markdown-based syntax

```
# Largest Heading
## Larger Heading
### Normal Heading
This is *bold text*
This is _italic text_
```

goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.MarkdownDecoration} />

**LIMITATIONS**: the underlined text and combinations of bold and italic are not supported yet.

## Bracket Link

The notation of bracket links is the same in both types of syntax.

```
[bracket link]
```

goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.BracketLink} />

You can configure the behavior of bracket links. For instance, the following bracket links are configured to open other
pages of this documentation.

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.ConfiguredBracketLink} />

## Hashtag

The notation of hashtags is the same in both types of syntax.

```
#hashtag
```

goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.Hashtag} />

An underscore (`_`) in a hashtag name will be translated to a half-width whitespace (` `). #hashtag_name means a hashtag
named as "hashtag name". You can configure the behavior of hashtag. For instance, The following hashtags are configured
to open other pages of this documentation.

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.ConfiguredHashtag} />

## Tagged Link

Tagged links are an original feature of React Clay Editor. The notation of tagged links is the same in both types of
syntax.

They are useful when users of your application refer various external resourses to speed up their writing. If you
develop a learning application or a business application, and users refer files in Box, search results of Google or
documents in your application, tagged links such as `[box: document_id]`, `[google: search_query]`, `[@: resource_name]`
work well to group and shorten link texts.

Another example is a technical blog application. Since users will often refer GitHub and NPM webpage to write articles,
tagged links `[npm: package_name]` and `[github: @username/repository_name]` will be useful. You can configure so that

```
[npm: react-clay-editor]
[github: @kumachan-mis/react-clay-editor]
```

goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.TaggedLink} />

Click links above if you want to visit NPM and GitHub webpage of React Clay Editor.

## Code String

The notation of code strings is the same in both types of syntax. The inline code string and the block code string are
supported.

````
inline code
`import React from 'react';`

block code
```
const App: React.FC = () => {
  const [text, setText] = React.useState('');
  return (
    <EditorRoot text={text} setText={setText}>
      <EditorTextFieldRoot>
        <EditorTextFieldBody />
      </EditorTextFieldRoot>
    </EditorRoot>
  );
};
```
````

goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.CodeString} />

## Math Formula

The notation of tagged links is the same in both types of syntax. The inline math formula, display math formula and the
block math formula are supported.

```
inline math formula
$x = r \cos \theta, y = r \sin \theta$

display math formula
$$I = \int_a^b f(x) \mathrm{d}x$$

block math formula
$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n}  \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n}  \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn}  \\
\end{pmatrix}
$$
```

goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.MathFormula} />

## Quotation

The notation of quotations is the same in both types of syntax.

```
> quotation
␣> nested quotation
```

(␣ means a whitespace) goes to

<Canvas of={FormattingSyntaxStories.Quotation} />
