# Editor

The editor is the main component of React Clay Editor. You can implement a range of editors by compounding components -
`EditorRoot`, `EditorTextFieldRoot`, `EditorHeader`, `EditorTextFieldBody`, `EditorSyntaxMenu` and your own components.

import * as EditorStories from '../ts/Editor.stories.tsx';

## Simple Editor

<Canvas of={EditorStories.SimpleEditorStory} />

## Fullwidth

`className` is available to overwrite the default styling.

<Canvas of={EditorStories.FullwidthStory} />

**NOTE**: a className selector in CSS should be **doubled**. Here is an example using `@emotion/css`.

```ts
const className = css`
  && {
    width: 100%;
  }
`;
// two ampersands (&&) is important
```

## With SyntaxMenu

The syntax menu helps users who are not familiar with syntactic writing.

<Canvas of={EditorStories.WithSyntaxMenuStory} />

## With Header

A text in the header is uneditable. It is useful to show a fixed title of a document. The header can be placed in both
of a fixed area and a scrollable area.

<Canvas of={EditorStories.WithFixedHeaderStory} />

<Canvas of={EditorStories.WithScrollableHeaderStory} />

## With User-Defined Footer

You can customize the editor as you like.

<Canvas of={EditorStories.WithUserDefinedFooterStory} />
