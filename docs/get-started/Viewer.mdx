# Viewer

The viewer is the readonly component of React Clay Editor. You can implement a range of viewers and even custom editors
by compounding components - `ViewerRoot`, `ViewerTextFieldRoot`, `ViewerHeader`, `ViewerTextFieldBody` and your own
components.

import * as ViewerStories from '../ts/Viewer.stories.tsx';

## Simple Viewer

<Canvas of={ViewerStories.SimpleViewerStory} />

## Fullwidth

`className` is available to overwrite the default styling.

<Canvas of={ViewerStories.FullwidthStory} />

**NOTE**: a className selector in CSS should be **doubled**. Here is an example using `@emotion/css`.

```ts
const className = css`
  && {
    width: 100%;
  }
`;
// two ampersands (&&) is important
```

## With Header

The header is useful to show a fixed title of a document. The header can be placed in both of a fixed area and a
scrollable area.

<Canvas of={ViewerStories.WithFixedHeaderStory} />

<Canvas of={ViewerStories.WithScrollableHeaderStory} />

## Dual-Paned Editor

You can implement a dual-paned editor by using the viewer and the standard `<textarea>`.

<Canvas of={ViewerStories.DualPanedEditorStory} />
